# exploratory-data-analysis-assignments
My assignments for STAT-S 670: Exploratory Data Analysis. This class was a graduate-level statistics course taught by Professor Julia Fukuyama in Spring 2023 at Indiana University Bloomington. The course focused on data visualization (univariate, bivariate, trivariate, and hypervariate) and inductive model building. The assignments utilize a plethora of statistical models: ordinary least squares, LOESS, poisson, principal components analysis, and much more. Each file contains the assignment instructions, code, and write-up (if required). Note: One of the data files ("cytof_one_experiment.csv") is too large to store in this repository.
